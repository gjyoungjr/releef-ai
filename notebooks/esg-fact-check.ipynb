      "Yes, there are examples of how stakeholder feedback has influenced sustainability initiatives. For instance, feedback received directly from supplier employees helps ensure that labor and human rights are respected throughout the global supply chain. This feedback is used to address emerging risks, improve rights training for supplier employees and management, and continually strengthen the Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards. Additionally, the feedback channels, such as interviews with supplier employees and third-party anonymous hotlines, allow for the collection of insights that lead to improvements in workplace conditions and compliance with labor standards. These mechanisms ensure that the voices of those within the supply chain directly contribute to the evolution and enhancement of sustainability practices.\n"
